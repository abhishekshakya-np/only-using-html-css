    <!-- It simply means that the characters that are used will be of UTF-8. It declares the page’s character encoding. It

    PC or mobile. It helps in making the website mobile friendly also. -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <!-- It helps any particular website to open in the highest compatibility mode available. It is mostly for those 
        who are still using Internet Explorer. Because there are still some people who have not upgraded their system and are still using the older versions. -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">

    <meta name="description" content="This is description">

    <!-- Keywords are those special words through which a user reach any website. You can add the keywords in the content part of the tag. -->
    <meta name="keywords" content="html, html tutorials, web development">

    <!-- If we want our website to be indexed in Google or other search engines and bots should follow all the links present on the website, then -->
    <meta name="robots" content="INDEX, FOLLOW">
    <title>Document</title>

<body>
    <h1>This is heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    <!-- to open the website in a new tab then you have to add a new attribute in the anchor tag I.e. “target" -->
    <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Go to google</a><br>

    <!-- Image is not present hence alt text is shown -->
    <!-- In the “alt" tag, we generally input a keyword of the image that can define the image in case the user can’t see the image. -->
